## 🧠 Game Description

The Snake Game is a timeless arcade-style game where the player controls a snake that moves continuously across the screen.

- The snake grows longer each time it eats food.
- Food appears at random positions with random colors.
- The player must avoid:
  - colliding with the screen boundaries
  - colliding with the snake’s own body

Once a collision occurs, the game ends and a **GAME OVER** message is displayed along with the final score.
